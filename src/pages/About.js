                As a kid growing up in the inner city I was too young to understand and appreciate how the subtle nudges and guidance from teachers and
                 other positive adults would play in my future success. When I became an adult and started to reflect on my past I was able to acknowledge 
                 how important those influences were in helping me navigate through some of lifeâ€™s choices. While looking around the world today I noticed 
                 there is still a gap in education and resources within lower-income communities and assisting in the goal to help educate the youth is the foundation 
                 of this Idea.
